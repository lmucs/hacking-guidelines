  Some guidelines simply have near-universal applicability. This where you’ll find them.

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt><h4>all-00</h4></dt>
      <dd><h4>Indent with spaces, not tabs.</h4></dd>
    </dl>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Reason</dt>
      <dd>
        Spaces are presented <em>way</em> more consistently than tabs are, and thus code indented
        with spaces will look more consistent than code indented with tabs, whether the code is in
        a browser, a terminal window, or an editor.
      </dd>

      <dt>Exceptions</dt>
      <dd>
        Languages where tabs have a specific meaning, such as in Makefiles.

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt><h4>all-01</h4></dt>
      <dd><h4>Maintain a maximum line length.</h4></dd>
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Reason</dt>
      <dd>
        As with <code>all-00</code>, the reason is again consistency. Some editors or code displays will auto-linebreak;
        others won’t. A suitable maximum line length is one that, most of the time, represents a typical horizontal
        display size. That way, even if auto-linebreak might happen, at this width it most likely won’t.
      </dd>

      <dt>Current Recommendation</dt>
      <dd>
        For current screen sizes, <code>120</code> fixed-width characters works well.
